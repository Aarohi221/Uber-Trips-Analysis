# Uber-Trips-Analysis
Uber is a popular taxi service in urban areas. A variety of people utilise Uber as a transportation mechanism, be it a drop to the office building from home or going out with friends at a specific location. 
In this project, I am utilizing uber trip's september 2014 dataset to get insights about consumer behaviour through variety of pattern such as the busiest hour for Uber or the day with most or least trips. I also analyse location specific distribution of uber trips. I used python to analyse this data.
